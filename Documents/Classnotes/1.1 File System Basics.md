#### The Command Prompt
- the command prompt is often called a terminal or command interface
- some operating systems only incude a command prompt
#### Many features of the operating system can be quickly and efficiently exucted via the command prompt
- running programs
- opening files
- creating or editing text files
- copying, moving or deleting files
- creating or deleting directories
#### Starting the command prompt is easy
- press the *Windows* key on your keyboard to open the *Start Menu*
#### File System on your ocmputer is organized into a tree structure. Your pc is at the root of the tree
#### Your PC contains one or more drives
- Most contemporary computers use some combination of internal drives
#### Every drive in your PC is identified by a drive letter
#### You may switch between drives on your computer from the command prompt by typing the drive letter followed bya colon into the prompt and pressing enter
- Case does not matter
#### Every file or directory in you rfile system is uniquely identified by its absolute path
- the path begins with the letter of the drive on which the file resides
- it includes the name of each directory and subdirectory
#### A file or directory may always be accessed by its absolute path e.g the path ```W:\Miss\Kitty``` can be used from anywhere in the file system to access specified directory or its conents
#### You may also move from one drive to another by typing the drive letter followed by a colon
- This will move your command prompt into the last directory you used on the drive, or the root directory if you have not used the drive yet
#### Once on a drive, you may change from one directory to another using the `cd` command
- when used with the name of a subdriectory will move the directory
#### Files are used to store data such as text, images, video, or executable applications
#### The file type is usually indicated using a file extension
- For legacy pruposes, most file extensions are 3 letters
#### Copying Files
- A copy of a file is a new file with a different pat that contatins the same data as the original file
- The `cp` command can be used to create a copy of a file. I t requires at least one argument: the name of the file
- An optional second argument can be used to specify the name of the copy
- A directory cannot conatin two files with the exact same name; trying to copy a file into a directory that already has a file with that name will cause an error
#### Moving Files
- The `cp` command will create a copy while the `mv` will create a copy but remove the original
